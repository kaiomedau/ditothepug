      <h1>Project History</h1>
      <p>
        My best friend of all time is my Pet Dito, a pug full of energy and with
        his priorities right, always toward food. ü•∞ He is in his best moment,
        with 8 yo and living the life at its fullest, and I started wanting to
        register that, so I could remember my best friend and celebrate his life
        while he is around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside that, one of my biggest frustrations has always been not knowing
        how to draw, something that I finally decided to face and register this
        entire process in a collection of NFTs, which is immutable and will
        forever live on the blockchain recording my steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, why not combine the two and make a collection of Dito while I learn
        how to draw?! It all then started with a Google search on ‚Äúhow to draw a
        Pug‚Äù, which presented me with an amazing tutorial by
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DrawSoCute">Draw So Cute</a>. Which I
        followed step-by-step, and I drew a lot until I had a version that was
        just as cute, but that already started to print some of my own way to do
        things. From there on, day after day I‚Äôve been drawing new Ditos and
        evolving in a way to find my own style and bring more joy and cuteness
        to the NFT community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, the collection took on new proportions and became loved by
        the people who found it and that created our lovely community, full of
        amazing people willing to help each other and accompany me on this
        journey of mine.
      </p>
      <p>Welcome and feel at home to be part of this community.</p>
